# 🏁 WIP Unofficial SDGT English Translation

Currently a **Work In Progress** community project.
This repository contains **JSON translation data** extracted for localization and educational use.
All files here represent **text-only content** — no binaries, models, or proprietary assets are included.

The goal is to make the game more accessible to English-speaking players through a **freely available, community-driven translation patch**.
All translated JSON will continue to be published here as development progresses.
